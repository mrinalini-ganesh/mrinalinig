Welcome to my GitHub! Here, you'll find a variety of projects I've written in Python. One notable project is a Raspberry Pi endeavor that combines my knowledge in Linux, switch configuration, Python coding, SSH, VNC Viewer, and LLDP. It focuses on documenting switch port connectivity, utilizing Raspberry Pi to display switch information, and employing LLDP and Python code. Additionally, you'll find several smaller projects, each with its own summary within the code. Dive in and explore!
